# python-slot-machine
This is just a small fruit machine I put together to fill up some spare time.

It is based on a catagory D AWP fruit machine with a five pound jackpot 

The code does look for a coin mechanism but will work without just press 1 for credit and space to spin

this is not intended to be a fully funtional game but maybe of use to somebody
